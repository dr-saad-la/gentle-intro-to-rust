# Rust Fundamentals

Now that you have Rust installed and have written your first program, it's time to dive deeper into the language fundamentals. This chapter will introduce you to the core building blocks of Rust programming.

In this chapter, we'll explore:

- Variables and data types
- Functions and how they work in Rust
- Control flow with conditionals and loops
- Basic operators
- Rust's commenting and documentation system

Understanding these fundamentals will give you the foundation needed to write meaningful Rust programs. Rust's syntax may look familiar if you've used other programming languages before, but there are some unique aspects that we'll highlight as we go.

Let's start with one of the most fundamental concepts in any programming language: variables and data types.
