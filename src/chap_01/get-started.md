# Getting Started

Welcome to the first chapter of our Rust journey! Before we can write any Rust code, we need to set up our development environment. In this chapter, we'll cover everything you need to get started with Rust programming.

Learning a new programming language involves more than just understanding the syntax. It's also about getting comfortable with the tools, the ecosystem, and the workflow. By the end of this chapter, you'll have a functioning Rust development environment and you'll write your first Rust program.

We'll cover:

- Installing Rust on your system
- Understanding Rust's package manager, Cargo
- Setting up a code editor or IDE for Rust development
- Creating and running your first Rust program
- Understanding the structure of a Rust project

Let's begin by installing Rust on your system.
